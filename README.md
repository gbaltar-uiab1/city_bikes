Data Analysis Project  - City Bike NYC

## Goals
This dataset contains a sample of bike trips from the City Bike system in New York City.
Each row represents one trip and includes information about the start and end stations, the duration, the
user type, and other contextual data like age, season, temperature, and weekday.
Uur goal is to explore this dataset and extract insights through data analysis with **Pandas**.

We'll practice basic pandas operations (loading, exploring, cleaning, transforming, summarizing) and use descriptive statistics and simple visualizations to support our answers.
